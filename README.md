==========================
## Project information
#### A simple matching game that tests the player's memory skills.  Pairs of eight different images are randomized on the screen.  Click a box to reveal the image, then click another to see if it's a match.  Once all the pairs are matched, the game is won. 
## Technologies used
#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flex, Grid

## Approach Taken
#### I began with the basic HTML and CSS elements, so that when I started my JavaScript code, I would be able to test it more easily.  Before starting the JavaScript, I tried to break up the logic into the smallest pieces possible and use pseudocode to outline them all.  As I progressed, I had to break up problems into even smaller pieces when I came upon an obstacle.

## Project Structure
#### Upon loading, eight different pairs of images are randomized into a 4x4 grid.  The player clicks on one box, then a second one and the program checks to see if they are a match.  If so, the images remain showing.  If not, the images are hidden again.  The process repeats until all of the matches have been made, when a box pops up showing a win message and a "Play Again" button.  Clicking on "Play Again" will reset the board.
## What went well
#### The HTML and CSS aspects of the project came much more easily to me than the JavaScript aspect.
## Hurdles
#### The first day I worked on the JavaScript, I spent hours trying to figure out why my images weren't loading onto the board.  Turns out, I had downloaded the wrong type of picture files (transparent png), and they had been loading all along, I just couldn't see them. I had a difficult time figuring out the logic for the gameplay to enter into JavaScript.  Also, I spent a lot of time tracking down and fixing syntax errors.
## Future features
#### Expanded board, timer, score
