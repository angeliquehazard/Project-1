## Project Structure
## What went well
#### The HTML and CSS aspects of the project came much more easily to me than the JavaScript aspect.
## Hurdles
#### I had a difficult time figuring out the logic for the gameplay to enter into JavaScript.  Also, I spent a lot of time tracking down and fixing syntax errors.
## Future features
#### Expanded board, timer, score
## Any other resources used
#### My awesome instructional team and colleagues! Also, Google.
